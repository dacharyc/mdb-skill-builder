A |fts| index is a data structure that maps documents from your {+cluster+}
to the terms that are extracted from those documents.
|fts| indexes enable efficient full-text searches of your database.

When you define a |fts| index, you can use :ref:`static or dynamic
mappings <fts-field-mappings>` to specify which fields or field types
you want to index in your collection. You can also use :ref:`analyzers
<analyzers-ref>` to define how |fts| extracts searchable tokens from
``string`` fields or query strings. Finally, you can apply additional
configuration options in your index definition to improve the
performance and accuracy of your |fts| query, including options to
:ref:`store source fields in your index <fts-stored-source-definition>`,
or :ref:`define synonym mappings <fts-field-mappings>`.

To learn how to define a |fts| index according to your query
requirements, see :ref:`ref-create-index`. Once you define your |fts|
index, you can add the index to your {+cluster+} with the :ref:`Create
a {+fts+} Index <create-fts-index>` tutorial. To learn how to view,
edit, update, or delete your |fts| index, see :ref:`fts-manage-indexes`.

This page describes the |json| syntax and definition options for a |fts| index.

.. _troubleshoot-mongot-process:

``mongot`` Process Not Installed or Running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error is returned if you run ``$search`` queries when
the |fts| ``mongot`` process isn't installed or running:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false

   MongoError: Remote error from mongot :: caused by :: Error connecting to localhost:28000.

The ``mongot`` process is installed only when the first |fts| index is
defined. If you don't have any |fts| index in your cluster,
create at least one |fts| index to resolve this error.
