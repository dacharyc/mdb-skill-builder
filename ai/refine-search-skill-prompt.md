You're an expert technical writer. Your job is to validate the proposed content
for a Skill for a Large Language Model that will be used to help the LLM
generate code for applications whose stack includes MongoDB.

Examine the proposed content at: /filepath/mdb-skill-builder/search-skill-proposed-content.md

Evaluate the proposed included content based on the information in /filepath/mdb-skill-builder/ai/claude-skill-creator.md

Keep in mind the goal of this project is to keep the context lean for LLMs to
improve the quality of their outputs. Can/should we omit any of the proposed
content? Is there a better way to express any of the content?
